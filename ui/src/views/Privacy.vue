      <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
      <i>The text further down and appropriately small is the legal version of the privacy policy. But we'd first like to highlight some points in a language lots of people can understand: English.</i>
      <p>1) It would be great if people paid to use a commercial cloud version of this product. That's the only way we intend to make any money from it. The only identifying information we save is email address, partly because we may need to send you transactional emails (and possibly some marketing stuff, but rarely), but mostly because you need to log in. Even when you sign in with Google all we save is your email address and Google user ID (the latter because it's what Google recommends). See the code for details.</p>
      <p>2) We might from time to time aggregate some stats from anonymized data in the database. Anything interesting that we find will be published publically, maybe on the site, maybe a blog. Not sure yet, but we'll let you know.</p>
      <p>3) Anytime you want your account deleted we will do so upon being asked. No worries.</p>

      <p>It is DiaLR's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our application. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://dialr.serotonin.ai">https://dialr.serotonin.ai</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://dialr.serotonin.ai"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, DiaLR collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. DiaLR's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how DiaLR's visitors use its website. From time to time, DiaLR may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>DiaLR also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://dialr.serotonin.ai blog posts. DiaLR only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

      <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>DiaLR discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on DiaLR's behalf or to provide services available at DiaLR's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using DiaLR's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. DiaLR will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, DiaLR discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when DiaLR believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of DiaLR, third parties or the public at large.</p>
      <p>If you are a registered user of https://dialr.serotonin.ai and have supplied your email address, DiaLR may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with DiaLR and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. DiaLR takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
